This module contains additional content for the PF2e system on Foundry.

The goal of this repository is to gather all related Foundry VTT PF2e content I use in my PF2e Campaigns and are not available elsewhere.

# Module Contents

## Dragonborn

The original Dragonborn ancestry as found in D&D 5<sup>th</sup> edition, with the various chromatic and metallic heritages. Also includes ancestry features and feats (up to 5<sup>th</sup> level.)

# Installation

Install this module by pasting this link: https://github.com/bushvin/bushvin-pf2e-expansion/releases/latest/download/module.json into the install module dialog on the Foundry Add-on Module tab.

Once enabled in a world it will add new compendiums, all beginning with "Bushvin's ".
