      <p>A pair of small, draconic wings grow from your back. While these wings
      aren’t strong enough to help you fly just yet, they allow you to travel
      longer distances when jumping. When Leaping horizontally, you move an
      additional 5 feet. You don’t automatically fail your checks to High Jump
      or Long Jump if you don’t Stride at least 10 feet first. In addition, when
      you make a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet further than
      your Athletics check result, though still with the normal maximum of your
      Speed.</p>
