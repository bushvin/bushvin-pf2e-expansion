      <p>You unfold your wings for travel and can keep them unfolded for 10
      minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed while your wings
      are unfurled. If you have Basic Flight, you gain a +10-foot status bonus
      to your fly Speed with Advanced Flight. As normal, since your fly Speed is
      derived from your land Speed, this status bonus isnâ€™t cumulative with a
      status bonus to your land Speed, if you have one.</p>
